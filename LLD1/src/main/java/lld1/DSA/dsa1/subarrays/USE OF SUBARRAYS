1. What is the Subarray Concept?

A subarray is a continuous part of an array.

Example array:
[5, 2, 8, 7, 1]

Subarrays include:

[5]

[5, 2]

[2, 8, 7]

[8, 7, 1]

[1]

Key rule:
✔ Elements must be next to each other (contiguous).
❌ You cannot skip elements → [5, 8] is not a subarray.

Why do we use subarrays?

Because many real-life problems require analyzing continuous time periods, such as:

last 7 days stock prices

last 10 seconds of network traffic

30-day spending history

continuous audio samples

contiguous GPS movement

→ All these are naturally represented as subarrays.

🧠 2. Techniques Used for Subarray Problems

Subarray problems often involve finding:

maximum/minimum sum

subarray counting

longest window

dynamic conditions inside a range

To solve these efficiently, several famous techniques are used.

⭐ Top Techniques for Subarray Problems
1. **Prefix Sum**

Used when you need fast sum of any subarray.

Precompute prefix array

Subarray sum = prefix[e] - prefix[s-1]

Useful for:

Range sum

Range updates

Frequency calculations

2. Sliding Window

Used when you need to process subarrays of fixed or variable size in O(n).

Examples:

Max sum subarray of size K

Longest substring without repeating characters

Finding subarray with given sum

Very powerful for continuous ranges.

3. Two Pointers

Similar to sliding window but more flexible.

Used for:

Sorted arrays

Sum problems

Expand-shrink window logic

Example: find number of subarrays with product < k.

4. Kadane’s Algorithm

Fastest way to find:

maximum subarray sum

maximum sum of any contiguous subarray

Time complexity → O(n)

Example:

max sum in [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4] = 6

5. Difference Array (Range Update)

Used when you need to apply many updates like:

Add +10 to elements from index 3 to 7

Add -5 to elements from index 1 to 4

Difference array helps do all updates in O(q + n).

6. HashMap Based Window

Used when you need to track:

frequency of elements

unique elements

constraints based on counts

Examples:

Longest subarray with at most K distinct numbers

Longest repeating character sequence

7. Binary Search + Prefix Sum

Used when subarray answer is monotonic.

Examples:

Minimum subarray length with sum ≥ x

Split array into m parts (LeetCode Hard)

8. Deque Optimization

Used for:

Sliding window maximum

Sliding window minimum

Gives O(n) for problems that would be O(n*k).
